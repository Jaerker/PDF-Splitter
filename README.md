# PDF-Splitter
Small project I made for myself in the company where I work, needed a pdf splitter and it turned out quite nice. Might add functions depending on if it needs.


When starting the project, just drag and drop the PDF files you want to split, press the button, and then theyget structured in seperate maps and indexed.

**split.py** is the start file.
